🧾 Project Overview

This project is the second task of my Data Analyst Internship, focusing on data visualization and storytelling using Power BI.
The dataset contains Amazon product reviews and sales details (self-collected/Kaggle), with information such as product names, categories, prices, ratings, discounts, and user reviews.

The goal was to design interactive dashboards that transform raw data into meaningful insights and help understand sales patterns, discount impact, customer ratings, and brand performance.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

🟨 Power BI – For creating visual reports and dashboards

🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy) – For data cleaning (Task 1)

📄 CSV Dataset: cleaned_amazon_products.csv

⚙️ Steps Followed
🪜 Step 1 — Import the Dataset

Loaded the cleaned dataset (cleaned_amazon_products.csv) into Power BI

Verified data types (numeric, text, date)

🪜 Step 2 — Data Preparation

Checked missing values

Standardized column names

Ensured proper data formats for visual analysis

🪜 Step 3 — Data Visualization

Created multiple visuals to represent different aspects of the dataset:

Chart Type	Purpose
KPI Cards	Show Total Sales, Average Rating, Average Discount
Bar Chart	Compare Sales by Category
Pie Chart	Visualize Category Distribution
Line Chart	Display Monthly Sales Trend
Tree Map	Show Brand Contribution to Total Sales
Stacked Column Chart	Compare Discounts vs. Sales
🪜 Step 4 — Storytelling

Added contextual insights and business interpretations:

Highlighted top-performing categories and discount effectiveness

Used titles and text boxes for storytelling

Applied consistent color themes (blue–gray) for clarity

Focused on data-driven conclusions, not just visuals

📈 Key Insights

✅ Electronics category generated the highest total sales and maintained strong average ratings.
✅ Fashion products offered the highest discounts but had lower sales volume and ratings.
✅ Home & Kitchen had moderate sales but excellent customer satisfaction.
✅ Ratings and Sales Volume showed a positive correlation — better-rated products sold more.
✅ Festive season (Oct–Dec) witnessed a noticeable sales spike.
