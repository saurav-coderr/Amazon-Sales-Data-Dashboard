# Amazon-Sales-Data-Dashboard
This project is the second task of my Data Analyst Internship, focusing on data visualization and storytelling using Power BI. The dataset contains Amazon product reviews and sales details (self-collected/Kaggle), with information such as product names, categories, prices, ratings, discounts, and user reviews.
